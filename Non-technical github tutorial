# Explanation of github for non-programmers
Since anyone can join to contribute, I will try to give a brief tutorial on github for those people who are not programmers or haven't used github before.

For a non-programmer, the simplest explanation of "github" (where the project files are hosted) is a google drive / dropbox shared folder, where anyone can edit files, and the files are synced to anyone who has the project downloaded. Pretty neat, huh ?

Github is not as automatic as google drive / dropbox though. You have to manually upload your updates, and download other people's updates. But you will see it won't be a hussly.

Also, you might see me saying words "repo" or "repository" often. It just means "this project on github", or equivalent to gdrive / dropbox's shared folder.

## Cloning project using github desktop
1. Download github desktop: https://desktop.github.com/
2. Sign in with your account on github desktop.
3. Clone this repository by going to file -> clone repository -> TM_online_remake
  - *You will not see the project unless you have editing permissions (see `Readme.md` file, requesting editing permissions to the project)*
4. You may be asked if you want to use github enterprise server, or regular server. Choose regular server in this case.

Now, the project should be available in folder where you specified to clone the repo in step 3. By default on (on windows and mac) it is in folder `Documents/Github/TM_online_remake`.

## Opening project in godot
You should now be able to run the project from godot editor by opening godot engine and clicking `Import` button.

## Running the project
Shortcut to run the project within editor is F5. You can also run the project from project's home screen (before you open this project)

### Running more than one instance of project (multiplayer testing)
On godot project selection screen (the screen which opens when you just open the godot engine), click the project and click `Run` button to the right. You can open new instance of godot and run project again. This way you will be able to join/host multiple games at the same time on your own machine.
