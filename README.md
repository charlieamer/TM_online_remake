# Twisted Metal-like online remake
This is a non-profit, fan-made and open-source project to re-create a game similar to "Twisted Metal". Main goal is to make a functional online multiplayer game.

# Technologies
Main technology at the moment is Godot engine, however, I plan to add node.js code that will manage servers.

# How to contribute
If you are a programmer and you already know how this git/github works, you don't need to read this, but please read "Requesting editing permissions to the project".

## Requesting editing permissions to the project
1. Create an account at github: https://github.com/join
2. Contact me with your github username with one of the following methods
  - *On discord - charlieamer#9302*
  - *Create an issue on this repository: https://github.com/charlieamer/TM_online_remake/issues/new asking for access*
    - *For example just write "I would like editing permissions on the project".*
    - *Also, optionally, write discord username if you have one, so we can communicate more efficiently.*

## Installing prerequisites
1. Download godot from here: https://godotengine.org/download. Godot is a game engine which is used in this project.
  - *This project doesn't use C#, so you don't need to download "Mono version (C# support)"*
  - *I advise you to download standard 64-bit version, but if it doesn't work (99% of cases it should work), download standard 32 bit*
